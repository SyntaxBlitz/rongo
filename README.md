I hate doing this, but **this project is on indefinite hold** while I work out whether or not I actually need to build it. The person with whom I was originally collaborating to make this project a reality has decided to step out to work on other projects, so I'm not sure if the project is actually worth completing (especially because it has hardly even been started!).

A project to display articles in a particulary pretty format.
